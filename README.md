# ZIL-Antarctica
Zero-degree isotherm (ZIL) in Antarctica

This is the Jupyter notebooks required to reproduce the research "Southward migration of the zero-degree isotherm latitude over the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Peninsula: extent and implications" <!--published in *Communications of Earth & Environment*. -->

This repository is divided in different notebooks that:

0. Plot the Maps presented in Figures 1 and S1
1. Compute and plot the melting season for Observations and ERA5 and its comparison
2. Compute and plot the climatological characterization of ZIL in ERA5
3. Compute and plot the past-recent annual and seasonal trends of ZIL in ERA5
4. Compute the annual and seasonal temperatures from monthly data in CMIP6 models 
5. Compute and plot the annual and seasonal trends in the Historical simulations in CMIP6 models and compare with ERA5
6. Compute and plot the trends in the future projections under the SSP2-4.5 scenario in CEMIP6 models
7. Compute and plot the trends in the future projections under the SSP5-8.5 scenario in CEMIP6 models
